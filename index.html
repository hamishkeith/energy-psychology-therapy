					<h3>EFT, or Emotional Freedom Technique</h3>
						<article data-readmore aria-expanded="false" id="ert">
						<p>EFT is one of the Energy Psychology Techniques, developed from the ancient Chinese meridian energy system.  It is a form of 'emotional acupuncture' – because it involves tapping on the end points of the body's energy meridians, while focusing on emotional issues.  It is based on the premise that all negative emotions are the result of a disruption in the body's energy system.</p>
						<p>Tapping sends pulses of energy which clear the blockage or disruption, and rebalance the body’s energy system in relation to a specific issue.  Shifting energy changes the way the brain processes information about a particular issue, and so tapping while tuned in to the issue is like rewiring or rerouting the brain's conditioned negative response.</p>
						<p>In our everyday experience, our bodies carry the effects of our thoughts – positive and negative, limiting and liberating.  Our thoughts, beliefs and feelings create the biochemistry of our body and shape our health and wellbeing.</p>
						<p>EFT helps release emotional pain; it also works in the same way to release the limiting thoughts and beliefs that get in the way of your success, happiness, health and inner peace.</p>
					</article>

					<div class="pfblock-line"></div>
						<h3>NLP, or Neuro-linguistic Programming</h3>
						<article data-readmore aria-expanded="false" id="nlp">
							<p>Neuro – how we process information and store past experiences in our minds</p>
							<p>Linguistic – the language we use to communicate our experience</p>
							<p>Programming – the patterns or programmes of thought and behaviour that either help or hinder us</p>
							<p>NLP uses specific techniques developed from an understanding of how the neurological system functions; and works by using language to change or enhance the patterns (programmes) that control our behaviour.</p>
							<p>It is often used by sports and business coaches to identify and enhance ways of achieving personal excellence.  People are capable of doing both positive and negative behaviours excellently.  When used in the therapeutic context, NLP can be very powerful to help identify and change limiting or harmful behaviours.</p>
						</article>
					<div class="pfblock-line"></div>	
						<h3>IET, or Integrated Energy Techniques</h3>
						<article data-readmore aria-expanded="false" id="iet">
							<p>IET brings together the best of energy psychology and ways of working with Ericksonian hypnosis, NLP, coaching, cognitive psychotherapy and psycho-spiritual approaches, to help release emotional pain and open the path to greater success and self-realisation.</p>
							<p>Some examples of how I use IET:
								<ul>
									<li>Clearing negative emotions with EFT before installing positive behaviours with NLP;</li>
									<li>Using EFT to clear a negative emotion which crops up during NLP work;</li>
									<li>Clearing difficult memories and changing the way the past is experienced.</li>
								</ul>

					        <li style="min-height: 500px;">I initially visited Tanya to explore EFT surrounding a back problem. <p>I felt some relief using EFT once I started let go of the emotions attached to the back problem and the accompanying root cause. I found Tanya's use of EFT and NLP anchoring particularly helpful with aligning my goals and emotions.</p> There had been a great deal of fear, mainly unconsciously connected to events from the past, which began to disintegrate once the vision of the goal became the predominant focus through exercises in reframing the future. I found the combination of EFT and NLP very powerful and I have felt a shift in my entire being as I am more positive about the future to the point of having a deep conviction of my future success. Considering I had only a few sessions, I am very pleased with the results as well the convenience of using these exercises myself to strengthen and solidify the "awakenings" that occurred in the sessions.</li>
					        
					        <li style="min-height: 550px;"><p>I had my first EFT session with Tanya in September 2012 and at that time I knew little about “tapping” and its many benefits.&nbsp; The issue that I wanted to work on was both long-standing and deep-seated; although I had made some progress with it over the years the underlying strength of emotion that it evoked continued to affect me very deeply when triggered.&nbsp; Because of this I had felt frightened to allow myself to fully “go there” and my tentative experiences with other (non EFT) therapists had reinforced my reluctance to do anything other than skirt around things; my belief and expectation was that most people would perceive my issue as fairly innocuous and just wouldn’t “get it.”</p>
				        	<p>Tanya has a calm and empathetic manner which immediately put me at my ease; her sensitive questioning skills encouraged me to trust her with my “story” and I began to open up.&nbsp; As the session progressed some very painful feelings surfaced and Tanya’s compassionate and intuitive response took me by surprise; I had found someone who, on first meeting, had genuinely honoured the powerful feelings of the child raging within me.&nbsp; Tanya really did “get it” and I had been heard.&nbsp; That, in itself, was a cathartic, validating experience which felt truly life-changing.</p>
				        	<p>Since then I have had several follow-up EFT sessions with Tanya and have continued to use tapping on myself. As I learn more about this gentle, yet powerful, healing tool I realise that what Tanya has done is to afford me a safe means of experiencing intensely painful emotions in a genuinely new and positive way; a way that ultimately facilitates their release and allows me to move forward unencumbered whilst gaining helpful insights and understanding about the “story” that had so consumed me.&nbsp; Thank you, Tanya.</p>

					        	I originally went to see Tanya to help with the fear of flying I had developed seven years ago.  I also mentioned newer anxieties that I felt were stress related these included anxiety when driving and  walking over bridges.  Tanya explained that dealing with anxiety could be like “felling trees” and that removing one could remove all.    Tanya is very calm and I immediately felt at ease even though I had not experienced tapping before.  We started with the driving anxiety and Tanya went through a process that involved tapping and reframing my anxiety. I still do not fully understand how it works but it seems to.  That night I had a vivid dream about trees falling around me and the following week I found myself driving confidently on a motorway in the rain, something that would have previously made me anxious.  I had one further sessions focusing on flying and will have some more prior to my next flight.  I have already recommended Tanya to friends and colleagues.
